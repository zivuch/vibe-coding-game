# WORDLE VARIANT - Vibe Coding Masterclass

## Project Overview

Build a personalized Wordle-style game from scratch. Start with core mechanics, then make it uniquely yours through theme, features, and polish.

---

## PHASE 1: CORE GAME (30 minutes)

**Goal**: Get a playable game working

### Step 1.1: Project Setup

- Create Next.js + TypeScript project
- Set up basic project structure
- Install any needed dependencies (none required initially)

### Step 1.2: Basic UI

- Create 6x5 grid of letter tiles
- Add keyboard input (on-screen keyboard component)
- Simple styling - just make it clear and functional

### Step 1.3: Core Game Logic

- Word validation (5-letter word check)
- Color feedback system:
  - Green: correct letter, correct position
  - Yellow: correct letter, wrong position
  - Gray: letter not in word
- Win/lose conditions
- Use a small hardcoded word list (10-20 words) for now

### Step 1.4: Basic State Management

- Track current guess
- Track previous guesses
- Track game status (playing/won/lost)
- Handle input and submit

**CHECKPOINT**: You should be able to play a complete game and win/lose

## PHASE 2: MAKE IT YOURS (45 minutes)

**Goal**: Pick your variant and implement it

### Choose Your Theme:

#### Option A: Dev Wordle

- 5-letter programming terms (ASYNC, REDUX, FETCH, CACHE, etc.)
- Update word list to programming vocabulary
- Add code-themed styling (terminal/IDE aesthetic)

#### Option B: Math Wordle (Nerdle)

- Guess equations that equal a target number (e.g., 12+34=46)
- Handle operators (+, -, \*, /)
- Different validation logic

#### Option C: Color Wordle

- Guess hex color codes (#FF5733)
- Show color preview after each guess
- Visual color similarity feedback

#### Option D: Custom Category

- Pick any 5-letter category you love
- Movies, cities, foods, whatever!
- Create your custom word list

### Step 2.1: Implement Theme Logic

- Update word validation for your variant
- Implement any special rules
- Update UI to reflect theme

### Step 2.2: Expand Word List

- Add at least 50-100 words for your category
- Implement random word selection
- (Optional) Add difficulty levels

**CHECKPOINT**: Your themed variant should be fully playable

## PHASE 3: POLISH & JUICE (45 minutes)

**Goal**: Make it feel like a real game

### Step 3.2: On-Screen Keyboard

- Full keyboard component with letter colors

  - Guess distribution (won in 1, 2, 3, etc.)
- Stats modal/display

### Step 3.4: Share Results

- Share text with your game variant name
- "Spoiler-free" format

### Step 3.5: Visual Polish

## NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION

### Tech Stack

- Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- No external game libraries needed!

### File Structure Suggestion

```
/app
  /page.tsx          # Main game component
  /components
    /Grid.tsx        # Letter grid
    /Keyboard.tsx    # On-screen keyboard
    /Tile.tsx        # Individual letter tile
    /Modal.tsx       # Stats/Help modals
  /lib
    /words.ts        # Word lists
    /gameLogic.ts    # Validation, checking
    /stats.ts        # Stats management
```

### Development Tips

- Start simple, add complexity gradually
- Test each phase thoroughly before moving on
- Don't worry about perfect code - focus on working features
- Animations can be added last if running short on time
- Use localStorage for persistence (no backend needed)
